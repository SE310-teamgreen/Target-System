# Database Info

"target_system.sql" is the database dump file for Target System. This
dump was created using PhpMyAdmin, but can be imported into a standalone
MySQL database using MySQL Workbench for example.

The database schema was adapted from the EdRepo database schema available at:
http://edrepo.sourceforge.net/
This schema was modified according to our database mapping.

The database contains data from the SWENET database dump provided as
a part of the SE410 course materials.
