Students must follow a systematic evaluation process, collect data, support conclusions, and synthesize what they have learned in the process.  An important side benefit is forcing the students to become familiar with the documentation standards early in the semester by studying them in the context of earlier projects.  This assignment is reasonable piece of individual writing within the context of a substantial writing component course.","45 minutes (presenting the requirements)","","3-10 hours (conducting investigation)","","2-5 hours (writing)","I have refined this assignment over several semesters.

Students work in small teams (two or three) to develop a comprehensive set of unit tests for a given module.  Some teams are given only the interface to the module, while others are given the interface and the code.  Algorithms and internal module design may vary.  Upon completion of the exercise, a team representative presents the team’s tests and the justification for them.  The instructor then leads the class in a comparison of the different sets of tests developed and expands on black and white box testing concepts.","30","","40","","","The order of lecture and exercise are reversed from what is typical; i.e., the exercise comes first.

In this lab, the students use TDD to extend two classes which are related by the Observer design pattern.
