177,This module has evolved from a course taught by Mark Ardis at Rose-Hulman University. This link currently leads to the site for the course as taught during the Spring 2005 semester.  The relevant lectures are those from April 14 through April 26.,http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse376/,1
178,A list of all the projects created in CS373 from 1997 to the present; many of these are good candidates for students to review as part of this assignment.,http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/s2s/admin/s2s-cross-ref.html,1
178,The documentation standards and other documents that guided the creation of the various projects.  The standards have evolved over the semesters.,http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/s2s/admin/s2s-documents.html,2
178,"Reviews from earlier semesters, organized by project and set up to make the student identity anonymous.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE REVEALED TO STUDENTS!  WHEN I MAKE THE ASSIGNMENT, I OFTEN CONCEAL THIS DIRECTORY ENTIRELY.  (This collection of the reviews has been useful int he process of evolving the projects for other uses.)",http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/s2s/reviews/,3
178,The projects at this site are more polished than those in the first resource.  These projects have been developed further for inclusion on UT Austin's UTOPIA site.  One can still reach the original project page from the menu on the left for each project.,http://z.cs.utexas.edu/users/s2s/utopia/home/allProjects.php,4
