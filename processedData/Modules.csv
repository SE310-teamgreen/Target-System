Upon completion of the exercise, a team representative presents the team’s tests and the justification for them.  The instructor then leads the class in a comparison of the different sets of tests developed and expands on black and white box testing concepts.",30,0,40,0,9,"The order of lecture and exercise are reversed from what is typical; i.e., the exercise comes first.  The idea is to allow the students to experience the difference between black and white box testing without any preconceived notions of what they are &quot;supposed to do.&quot;  Also, note that this module is incomplete.",2,52,1,smitchel,smitchel,This module is under development.  I intend on using it for my fall 2005 introductory software engineering class.
147,21:14.5,"In software engineering project courses, different teams may work on different projects and often need to use different software tools, languages, and platforms to complete the projects. It is neither practical nor interesting to all students to teach all necessary technologies in classroom. The technology evaluation and review assignment is an attempt to help students learn new technologies independently and work in teams to adopt new technologies in their projects. This individual assignment consists of three to five stages and runs in parallel with term-long team projects.",25,0,0,300,9,"The assignment consists of five stages, two of which are optional.",4,40,2,changliu,changliu,Updated the size of this module.

189,23:59.8,"The goal of this lab is for the students to practice test driven development activities.  The language is Java and the test environment is JUnit, but is generalizable to other languages/tools.  In this lab, the students use TDD to extend two classes which are related by the Observer design pattern.  This requires the development of a relatively simple mock object, but is a good introduction to TDD and mock objects.",0,120,0,0,9,,2,89,1,wellington,wellington,I think this is complete.
